# Summary

(Also Quidditch Beirut, for the traditionalists ;) )

This is a simple "Quidditch" hoop set for the increasingly popular Quiddich Pong game. Its basically American Beer Pong with hoops added to the game board for more complex gameplay.

I have included a simple printable rod (with ends that should snug nicely into the base and hoop) that fits diagonally within my meager 150x150mm build platform, but for higher hoops you can simply use a length of 6mm diameter dowel rod, commonly available from your local hardware and craft goods stores.

According to hours of intense and highly scientific alcohol related research, they work quite well!

Please feel free to share, modify and enjoy.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: RepRap
Printer: Prusa i2
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
20% infill should be plenty, this isn't a high impact part, but you could print it at 100% infill if you have particularly unruly partygoers.

If you intend to scale this for larger hoops, just bear in mind that unless you also use the printed rod scaled by the same amount, you will need to do a little math to figure out what the new rod diameter needs to be. The holes are both 6mm diameter at 100% scaling.
